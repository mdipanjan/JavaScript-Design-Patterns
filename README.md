| [Singleton Pattern](./Creational/Singleton/singleton.md) |  This is a class based creational design pattern where single classes can be instantiated and we can use that globally. This single instance can be used throughout the applcation.                        |
| [Prototype Pattern](./Creational/Prototype/prototype.md)            | This is a creational design pattern which uses JavaScript's native prototypal inheritance. The idea here is to use a skeleton of an existing object to create instances.             |
